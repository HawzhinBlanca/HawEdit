## D-001 · Implementation language and layout — Python under `hawedit2/`

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §2, §7 · **Type:** judgment call, not a deviation

The blueprint's entire stack is Python (KLPT, pyannote.audio 4.x, `omnilingual_asr`,
PySceneDetect, Silero, fontTools) plus ffmpeg. The host repo (`Codystem`) is a TypeScript
harness; its gate (`scripts/verify.sh`) lints `src/**/*.ts` only and its
`surface-manifest.sha256` covers root `scripts/` and `.github/`. `hawedit2/` is therefore
self-contained with its own gate so neither project's CI can silently pass the other's code.

**Measurement:** `bash hawedit2/scripts/verify.sh` runs ruff + mypy + pytest over
`hawedit2/` only; root `bash scripts/verify.sh` is unaffected (verified green after this
change).

## D-002 · Dependency licence audit — all permissive, no NC

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §7, gate "no new dependency without a licence check"

| Dependency | Version | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `klpt` | 0.1.7 | **CC BY-SA 4.0** | ACCEPT (not NC) — obligations below |
| `chunspell` (klpt dep) | 2.0.4 | LGPL-2.1+/MPL (hunspell binding) | ACCEPT — dynamic-linked binding, not modified |
| `pytest` | dev | MIT | ACCEPT |
| `ruff` | dev | MIT | ACCEPT |
| `mypy` | dev | MIT | ACCEPT |

Licence read from the published wheel metadata, not from a README:
`klpt-0.1.7-py3-none-any.whl` → `METADATA` → `License: CC BY-SA 4.0`.

**KLPT obligations.** CC BY-SA 4.0 is not NonCommercial, so it clears the hard-reject gate.
It does carry two obligations, which go in the same shipped-attribution bucket as pyannote
Community-1 (CC-BY-4.0, §7):

1. **Attribution** — Sina Ahmadi / KLPT must be credited in shipped product docs.
2. **Share-alike on adapted material** — we consume KLPT unmodified as a library. If we
   ever vendor or modify its rule tables, ShareAlike attaches to that adaptation. Flagged
   so it is a decision, not an accident.

## D-003 · KLPT `normalize` covers 4 of the 5 §4.1 collisions — measured

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §4.1 · **Type:** measured gap in a blueprint-mandated tool

Ran `klpt.preprocess.Preprocess("Sorani", "Arabic", numeral="Latin")` against each collision
listed in §4.1:

| §4.1 collision | Input | `normalize()` output | Covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ه` + ZWNJ vs `ە` | `ئه‌مه‌ زۆر باشه‌` | `ئەمە زۆر باشە` | YES |
| Arabic `ي`/`ك` → Farsi | `كوردي` | `کوردی` | YES |
| Farsi numerals | `ساڵی ۲۰۲۵` | `ساڵی 2025` | YES |
| Eastern Arabic numerals | `ساڵی ٢٠٢٥` | `ساڵی 2025` | YES |
| Conjunctive `و` separation | `من وتو` | `من وتو` (unchanged) | **NO** |

`normalize()` already unifies numerals, so `unify_numerals()` is not called separately.
`standardize()` performs orthographic standardization, *not* normalization — it left every
collision above untouched and must not be substituted for `normalize()`.

**Deviation:** §4.1 attributes conjunctive-`و` separation to AsoSoft ("AsoSoft applies a
separation algorithm"), and KLPT does not implement it. Correct separation needs a lexicon
(`وتو` is ambiguous without one). Rather than guess, this is left unimplemented and
**asserted as a known gap in the test suite**, so the day it is implemented the test tells us.
Deferred to M1, tracked in `PROGRESS.md`.

**Consequence today:** the index will treat a joined `و` and a separated `و` as distinct.
Character 3-grams (§2) absorb part of this; the residual is unmeasured until M0 has audio.

## D-004 · `--fast` gate mode

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** none · **Type:** infrastructure

`hawedit2/scripts/verify.sh --fast` runs lint + typecheck only, for use as an editor/hook
feedback loop. The full gate — the one that decides DONE — always runs tests. `--fast` can
never print the full-gate success line.

---

## D-005 · Two real defects found in the gate by its own tests

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** none (infrastructure) · **Type:** defect + fix

Writing M0.1's tests before trusting the gate paid for itself immediately.

**Defect 1 — the anti-cheat could not see an empty command.** The gate read its steps as
`${LINT_CMD:-default}`. The `:-` form substitutes the default when the variable is unset
**or empty**, so `LINT_CMD=` — an operator explicitly asking to run nothing — silently
became the real linter. The no-op refusal never fired because by the time it ran, the value
was no longer empty. Fixed by switching every step to `${VAR-default}` (no colon), which
substitutes only when unset. `LINT_CMD=` now reaches `_noop_check` and is refused.

**Defect 2 — the gate could fork-bomb itself.** `tests/test_gate.py` invokes the gate to
assert its refusal behaviour. Any invocation that reached the test step ran
`pytest` → `test_gate.py` → gate → `pytest` → … Observed live: 235 processes before the
run was killed. Defect 1 was the trigger (the empty-`LINT_CMD` case fell through to a full
run), but the recursion was latent and would have returned with any future test that shells
out to the gate.

Fixed with a depth guard: the gate exports `HAWEDIT2_GATE_DEPTH`, and a nested invocation
refuses to run the **test step** (exit 4) while still permitting lint/typecheck, so
`--fast` remains usable from inside a test. Asserted by
`test_nested_full_gate_refuses_instead_of_recursing` and
`test_nested_fast_run_is_still_allowed`.

**Measurement:** `bash hawedit2/scripts/verify.sh` → 9 passed, `VERIFY OK`, no recursion.

## D-006 · Normalization: numeral target, and measured whitespace behaviour

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §4.1, §8.1 · **Type:** judgment call + measurement

**Numeral target = Latin.** §4.1 lists Farsi (`۰۱۲`), Eastern Arabic (`٠١٢`) and Western
(`012`) as all occurring in real Kurdish text, and requires unification, but does not name
the target. Latin is chosen because it is what timestamps, IDs and the §5 JSON contract
already use, so a normalized transcript carries exactly one numeral convention rather than
two. Reversible: it is a constant in `normalize.py`.

**Whitespace — measured, and not what I first assumed.** The test written for M0.3 asserted
that KLPT collapses internal whitespace. It does not, and the test failed:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `"   "` | `""` |
| `"  ئەمە  "` | `"ئەمە"` |
| `"ئەمە    زۆر"` | `"ئەمە    زۆر"` (4 spaces preserved) |

So `normalize()` strips the ends and leaves internal runs alone. The assertion was corrected
to the measured behaviour rather than the assumed one, and pinned — this is exactly the kind
of detail a library update changes quietly.

**Consequence:** normalized CER alone would charge a model for spacing it cannot reliably
produce in a morphologically rich, clitic-heavy script. That is why §8.1 asks for a
spacing-free CER *alongside* it, and both are implemented in M0.5.

## D-007 · Lint: RUF001/2/3 (ambiguous unicode) disabled project-wide

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §4.1 · **Type:** infrastructure

These rules flag characters *confusable with ASCII*. The collisions this project actually
cares about are Arabic-script-internal — Arabic `ي` vs Farsi `ی`, `ه`+ZWNJ vs `ە` — which
look nothing like ASCII and which the rules never fire on. So they provide no §4.1
protection whatsoever.

What they do fire on is every `§` and en dash quoted verbatim from `BLUEPRINT.md`, and every
Kurdish string in the test fixtures — which must contain the confusable characters, since
that is the thing under test. Disabling them loses no coverage. The real protection is
`tests/test_normalize.py`, which asserts every §4.1 collision resolves.

## D-008 · Definitions §8.1 names but does not specify

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §8.1 · **Type:** judgment call

§8.1 lists "named-entity error" and "code-switch error" without defining them. Chosen
definitions, and why:

**Named-entity error = fraction of annotated entities absent from the normalized
hypothesis.** Matching is exact after §4.1 normalization, so a keyboard difference is not
scored as a lost name, but a near-miss is: a name 90% right is still the wrong name in a
burned-in caption, and §8.2 identifies misleading output as the error class that matters
most to a media organisation. Strictness here is deliberate.

**Code-switch error = mean CER over annotated switched spans, each located by best
substring alignment.** Spans are annotated in isolation but occur embedded in surrounding
Kurdish, so the metric aligns each span against any substring of the hypothesis (free
prefix/suffix). A whole-utterance CER would dilute a destroyed switch into invisibility —
which is the exact reason §8.1 breaks it out as its own metric.

**Unmeasured returns `None`, never 0.0.** An item with no annotated entities has no
named-entity error. A 0.0 would render in a report as a perfect score. §1: "Fail visible,
not silent."

**CER is not clipped at 1.0.** Standard definition; a model hallucinating past the end of
the reference should be able to score above it, and clipping would hide exactly that.

All four are testable choices, not conventions to remember: see `tests/test_metrics.py`.

## D-009 · "Several hours" is enforced as a 3.0-hour floor

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §8.1 · **Type:** judgment call

§8.1 asks for "several hours" of labelled audio without a number. `MINIMUM_HOURS = 3.0` —
the smallest quantity "several" honestly describes — is enforced as a **floor, not a
target**: a corpus below it fails `assert_section_8_1_coverage()` with the shortfall named.

Why enforce anything at all: the coverage grid alone is gameable. Three dialects × seven
conditions can be "fully covered" by 21 thirty-second clips, which satisfies every cell and
measures nothing. The hours check and the grid check together are what make coverage mean
something.

It is one constant, and the right way to change it is evidence from a real run — not a
convenient number.

## D-010 · What "material gain" and "acceptable throughput" mean in §8.1's decision rule

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §8.1, §4.4 · **Type:** judgment call

§8.1: "LLM-7B stays canonical unless another model shows a material accuracy gain on *your*
audio at acceptable throughput." Neither "material" nor "acceptable" is given a number.

**Material = ≥10% relative reduction in normalized CER** (`MATERIAL_GAIN_RATIO`). Relative,
not absolute: an absolute threshold means something different at CER 0.30 than at 0.06.
Ten percent sits clear of run-to-run noise while still admitting a real improvement. It is a
floor for *considering* a switch, never sufficient on its own.

**Acceptable throughput has no default — the caller must state `max_rtf`.** It is a capacity
decision about a specific box and workload, and §3 Stage 1 explicitly warns against deriving
it from Meta's A100 figures. A default here would be a fabricated number wearing the
authority of a constant. The check uses **worst-case** RTF, not mean: a batch pipeline is
sized by its slow items.

**A fourth clause the sentence does not contain, from §4.4: no dialect may regress.** A
challenger that wins on average while losing Mukriyan has not won, it has averaged. This is
the entire reason per-dialect numbers exist, and enforcing it in the rule is what stops the
aggregate from quietly becoming the decision.

**A fifth, from ordinary caution: the incumbent must be in the run.** `decide_canonical`
raises if it is absent rather than promoting whichever model happens to be present — that is
precisely how a pinned choice disappears without anyone deciding to unpin it.

Aggregates are **micro-averaged** (total edits over total reference characters). A macro
average lets a five-character item weigh as much as a five-hundred-character one, which on a
corpus mixing news and podcast material reports a different number than anyone means by
"CER".

Failed items are counted as failures and excluded from accuracy. Dropping them silently
would reward a model for choking on the audio it finds hardest.

## D-011 · The diarization control lives outside the §7 registry

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §7, §3 Stage 0, §8.1 · **Type:** blueprint inconsistency, resolved without deviating

§7's registry table lists **only** `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`. But two other
places require its predecessor:

- §3 Stage 0: "Keep `speaker-diarization-3.1` (MIT) as a benchmark control."
- §8.1: "Also run here: pyannote Community-1 vs 3.1 on Kurdish multi-speaker material."

So the blueprint requires running a model its own registry table does not list. Adding 3.1 to
`REGISTRY` would break the gate rule "nothing in the model registry that isn't in §7" — and
that rule is enforced mechanically, by parsing §7, so the conflict is a test failure and not
a matter of opinion.

**Resolution:** a separate `BENCHMARK_CONTROLS` mapping. §7's table stays authoritative for
what ships; the control is available for measurement only. `resolve()` does not find it, and
`routable` is `False`, so no pipeline stage can select it even by accident. Asserted in
`tests/test_registry.py`.

This is not a request to amend the blueprint — §3 Stage 0's instruction is unambiguous and
the distinction between "ships" and "is benchmarked against" is real. Flagged because a
future reader comparing §7's table to the code would otherwise find an apparent extra model.

## D-012 · Interim corpus authorised — public Sorani data, with hard limits

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §8.1, §1 · **Type:** authorised deviation

Hawa authorised using a public Sorani corpus as an interim set while the real labelled
material is assembled. §8.1 wants measurement on *your* audio, so the deviation is bounded
in code rather than by intention:

1. Imported items carry **no dialect and no condition**. Common Voice has neither, and
   inventing them would fabricate exactly the evidence §4.4 exists to protect.
2. Unlabelled hours **fill no coverage cell and count toward no minimum**.
   `assert_section_8_1_coverage()` still fails on an interim corpus.
3. `Corpus.provenance.interim` propagates into the benchmark report's JSON, and
   `bench.decide_canonical` **refuses to switch the canonical model on interim data** no
   matter how large the measured gain. It will name a challenger worth testing properly;
   it will not move the pin. §1: "No model changes without measurement."
4. Durations are required from the source, never defaulted — a default would fabricate both
   the real-time factor and the hours figure.

What the interim set buys: proof the harness runs end to end on real Kurdish, and a place to
measure §4.1 collision incidence (D-013). What it does not buy: any threshold, any model
decision, or the closure of M0.

## D-013 · Measured: §4.1's table is missing a collision (U+06BE vs U+0647)

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §4.1, §0 · **Type:** measured gap in the blueprint

Ran the §4.1 collision detectors over KLPT's bundled Sorani lexicon — 24,894 entries, 24,051
distinct forms. Full evidence: `evidence/collision-incidence.md`.

**0.84%** of entries are altered by normalization; **0.21%** of distinct forms merge with
another form, i.e. would have been two index entries that never match.

Every one of those merges came from a pair §4.1's table does not list: **`ھ` U+06BE ARABIC
LETTER HEH DOACHASHMEE against `ه` U+0647 ARABIC LETTER HEH** — 204 affected entries, in
ordinary high-frequency words (`دهۆک`/`دھۆک` Duhok, `جیهان`/`جیھان` world, `بەهار`/`بەھار`
spring). KLPT resolves it, so §4.1's mandate covers it in practice; the *table* does not
mention it, so nobody working from the blueprint would think to test for it.

The rule is **contextual**: KLPT rewrites `ھ`→`ه` inside a word and leaves an isolated `ھ`
untouched. Pinned by a test, because a library update changing it would silently shift every
index key without failing anything.

**Action taken:** `heh_doachashmee` added to the measured collision set. **Not** a blueprint
amendment — §4.1's normalization mandate already covers it via KLPT. Recorded so §4.1's table
can be corrected at the next revision.

**Honest limit on the number.** A curated dictionary is close to already-normalized, so
0.21% is a **floor**, not an estimate for real text. `ه`+ZWNJ and Arabic-keyboard `ي`/`ك`
scored zero here precisely because a lexicon does not contain typing artefacts — which is
where §4.1's other collisions actually live. The measurement worth acting on is the same
script over real transcripts, and that is blocked on M0.12.

## D-014 · Sentence-pause threshold and the completeness rule

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §4.2, §5, §3 Stage 5 · **Type:** judgment call

§4.2 requires segmenting on "Kurdish punctuation *plus* VAD pauses" and names no pause
threshold. `DEFAULT_PAUSE_MS = 500` — a conversational sentence break rather than a breath.
It is a **parameter, not a constant to trust**: the right value comes from real Kurdish
conversational audio, which is M0.12. Both `segment_sentences` and its VAD input take it
explicitly so tuning is a call-site change.

**Why the pause path is not optional.** §4.2 warns that ASR punctuation for low-resource
languages is unreliable. If it is absent entirely — the realistic case for Kurdish
conversation — a punctuation-only segmenter returns one enormous sentence, §5's anchors
collapse onto the whole segment, and "a clip never starts or ends mid-sentence" stops meaning
anything while every test still passes. `test_punctuation_alone_would_have_returned_one_sentence`
exists to keep that failure visible.

**Completeness.** A sentence is complete when closed by punctuation or by a pause — the
speaker finished it. A trailing run of words that merely ran out of segment is a fragment
(`complete=False`). §5's contract: `sentence_complete == false ⇒ reject, never render`.

**`anchors_for` returns `None` rather than a best guess** when a selection contains no
complete sentence. §3 Stage 5: "If no sentence boundary exists within tolerance, extend to
the next one or reject the candidate." A plausible-looking anchor derived from a fragment is
exactly how a clip that starts mid-sentence reaches a client — the caller must decide to
extend or reject, and cannot do that if the anchor function hides the problem.

## D-015 · "Materially disagree" in §3 Stage 1's escalation rule

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §3 Stage 1 · **Type:** judgment call

§3 Stage 1 routes to the validator "any segment where LLM-7B and CTC-3B disagree materially"
without defining materially. `DEFAULT_DISAGREEMENT_CER = 0.15` — normalized CER between the
two hypotheses. Measured after §4.1 normalization, so the two models typing the same Kurdish
with different keyboards is agreement, not a reason to spend the validator's 4 GiB.

A tunable awaiting real audio: the right value is whatever separates "the models heard
different words" from "the models spelled the same words differently", and that boundary is
empirical. Configurable per call.

**The quartile is relative, not a threshold.** Log-probability scales vary with audio and
model, so an absolute cutoff escalates everything on one recording and nothing on the next.
`len(scores) // 4` segments; with fewer than four there is no bottom quarter and confidence
escalates nothing, though disagreement still applies.

**The prohibition is enforced structurally.** §3 Stage 1: "Never escalate on duration or
word-count heuristics." `duration_s` is carried on `SegmentScore` for reporting and read by
no code path, and two tests assert that batches differing only in duration — or only in word
count — produce identical decisions. Length is the cheap proxy for difficulty and it is
wrong: 38 seconds of clean studio speech needs no validator; three seconds of overlapping
Slemani conversation does.

## D-016 · §2 index: field weighting and tokenization choices

**Date:** 2026-08-06 · **Blueprint ref:** §2, §4.1 · **Type:** judgment call

§2 mandates "BM25 + character 3-grams over the normalized transcript" without saying how the
two combine. Choices:

**Two separately scored BM25 fields, combined as `word + 0.5 × ngram`.** Both contributions
survive onto every `SearchHit`, so the balance is visible and tunable rather than baked into
one opaque number. 0.5 is set so an exact word match outranks pure morphological overlap
(`test_word_matches_still_outrank_mere_ngram_overlap`) while a clitic-attached variant is
still retrievable at all. A tunable awaiting §8.2's real candidates.

**N-grams are per word, with boundary padding** (`\x02word\x03`) rather than over the whole
string. Cross-word grams would match on accidental letter runs spanning a space; padding
means `کتێب` standing alone and `کتێب` heading `کتێبەکەم` share their interior grams but
differ at the trailing boundary — which is exactly the gradient that keeps exact matches
ahead of relatives.

**k1 = 1.2, b = 0.75** — Okapi's standard defaults, exposed as parameters. §8.2 tunes
retrieval against real candidates; convention is a starting point, not evidence.

**Queries are normalized too.** An index that normalizes its documents but not its queries
has §4.1's bug with extra steps. Asserted by
`test_encoding_differences_do_not_prevent_a_match`.

**Why this is not optional.** With word-level BM25 alone, querying the stem `کتێب` against a
document containing only `کتێبەکەم` scores **exactly zero** — measured, not asserted, in
`test_the_failure_section_2_describes`. §2's warning that "word-level matching misses
variants a human reads as identical" is the literal behaviour of the field without n-grams.
